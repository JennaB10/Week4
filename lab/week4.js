// Week 4 lab â€“ Similar to last week's lab â€“Â but without the help!

// The provided code now goes out to the Internet to get our products data.
// You can visit the provided URL â€“ https://kiei451.com/api/products.jsonÂ â€“
// in Chrome to see what the data looks like.

// Write a loop to iterate through the product data; each iteration of the loop
// should call a function called renderProduct, which accepts an object representing
// a single product object as input, and appends HTML to an existing element on the page
// with the class "products". You can use the existing HTML in the "products" element
// as a template, deleting it when you're finished.

// ðŸ”¥ define your renderProduct function here

// Curly bracket means an object
//products is an array 

async function pageLoaded() {
  let response = await fetch('https://kiei451.com/api/products.json') //this is grabbing data at this URL
  let json = await response.json()

  // writes the returned JSON to the console
  console.log(json)  //json is a object
  
//1. get the data you are working with - the array is the products
let products = json.products // this is so you don't have to keep writing json.products
//console.log(products)

 //2. write code to loop through the products

 //functions need 2 things: define the function and then call the function - need to pass an object to the function which means an item inside the () in this example it's product
 let renderProduct = function(product) {
  //because of the way Javascrip executes you need to define this function way on top CANNOT BE AFTER THE LOOP
  return ` 
  <div class="p-4 w-full md:w-1/2 lg:w-1/3">
          <div class="border h-full p-4 flex flex-col">
            <h2 class="text-lg font-bold mb-4">${product.name}</h2> 
            <div class="mb-4"><img src="${product.image}">
            </div>
            <div class="mb-4 text-gray-900">
              ${product.description}
            </div>
            <div class="mt-auto text-purple-500 text-2xl">$${product.price}</div>
          </div>
        </div>`
 }
 //we don't want to continuously redefine this function for #4
for(let i=0; i < products.length; i++) {
  let product = products[i] //as the loop iterates it pulls each subsequent product from the array
  //console.log(product) //prodcut is going to be an object with these 4 attributes
// step by step we are digging into the data
// if i was 0 - then it would always be the first product 
  //let product1 = products [0]
  //let product2 = products [1]
  //let product3 = products [2] etc
  // lots of writing use i instead.  
  // if said product.name then we just see all the names

//3. render each product: make it work first - we need 2 things
// we need to select an html element in our html file - attach data to html
// we need to do that by rendering html

let element = document.querySelector('.products')
//console.log(element)

console.log(product)

//will select div however many times there is

//4. then extract to the separate renderProduct
element.insertAdjacentHTML('beforeend', renderProduct(product))

      // why curly brack and $ sign? product is the object and we use ${} is syntax specific to string concatination
      // if you wrap anything that's not a string in `` it will force it into a string 
//console log is the easiest way for us to test something that we've done if it's working
// any time you're rendering data in a dynamic function from html use `

//4. call 





}




  // ðŸ”¥ start here: write code to loop through the products; each
  // iteration of the loop should call your renderProduct function
  // make it work first; then extract to the separate renderProduct
  // function after it's 100% working without it
